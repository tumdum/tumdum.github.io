Comparison of 3 different ways for binding functions with parameters in c++.
What is of interest here is vast difference (>2x) between lambdas and binds
in default (rtti + exceptions) case, and even bigger when both rtti and 
exceptions are disabled (~3.8x).

See [listing]({{ site.baseurl}}/files/lambda_vs_bind.tar.xz) for files needed to reproduce this locally.
Calling generate.sh will produce every file seen in stats`* directories.
All results have been generated using "g++ (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1) 4.8.2".

Things of note:

 - boost based solution increases in size when compiled without rtti. This is
   because boost rolls its own solution for rtti.
 - but decreases (slightly) when compiled also without exceptions
 - best case scenario for boost is worse than any worst case scenario for either
   of other solutions
 - gcc std solution responds very nicely to disabling rtti, and reduces some
   more when exceptions are removed
 - best case for lambda is more than 4 times smaller than worst case for boost
   and always better significantly than gcc std

For detailed statistics please see `stats_gcc` directory in listing archive from
beggining of the post.
